HomIOT.Server
=============

node js server for HomIOT System.  
Used for proxying data between Hardware and Web/Mobile App.

Very simple server that gets [HomIOT.Arduino](https://github.com/vladkosarev/HomIOT.Arduino) data and communicates it to [HomIOT.Mobile](https://github.com/vladkosarev/HomIOT.Mobile) application.

Take a look at the source, it should be pretty self explanatory. Once your pin/port setup is done, run node app.js and now you have a running server that will take in data from hardware.
